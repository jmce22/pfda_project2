    "### Introduction ###\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is the second of two projects I have completed for the \"Programming for Data Analysis\" module of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics in ATU Ireland.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the project is to analyse various aspects of climate data from the Paleolithic (oldest dataset goes back to 820,000 years ago) up to the present day. I will make predictions for future climate data based on recent trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will begin with the importing of libraries used to analyse the data. I will then load up the datasets and amend them to prepare them for analysis. The data-cleansing section will also describe the data which is contained in each dataset and plot some of them to provide a sense of how the data in each is distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will then compared the datasets relating to CO2 levels to each other and amalgamate them, before plotted them against the data for the Antarctic temperature anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I will plot data for CH4 (Methane) against the Antarctic temperature anomaly and analyse the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will then plot CO2 and CH4 against each other over the full 820,000 timespan of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next I will investigate climate change signals within an Irish context by analysing the trends for temperature and rainfall at Mullingar weather station; I will measure these by calculating anomalies for each year in the dataset relative to a base period. Then, I will analyse the temperature anomaly against the Global temperature anomaly, and the temperature and rainfall anomalies against each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I complete this data analysis, I will fuse my datasets for CO2, CH4, temperature and rainfall into one composite dataframe, before exporting it to csv and json files; these are found in this repository under the titles \"composite climate data.csv\" and \"composite climate data.json\" respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing this, I will use a linear regression model to predict how the global temperature anomaly would unfold between now and 2100, under the assumption that the trend in this anomaly since 1950 would continue in a linear fashion; I will compare my findings witrh the published findings in the \"Summary for Policymakers\" document written by climate experts for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "My project will conclude with a summary of my findings and thoughts on completion of the project, followed by a list of references I used to complete my work."

    "I have downloaded multiple climate related datasets online. These datasets can be found in the subfolder 'climate_data' in this repository; they are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Atmospheric **carbon dioxide** concentratons from a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); most recent year in dataset is 2001.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Atmospheric **carbon dioxide** concentrations from a 2008 paper in Nature by Luthi et al; the most recent year in this dataset is 1870 (137 years prior to 2007).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Atmospheric **carbon dioxide** data from the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, providing annual data from 1959 to 2022, when precise measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide first began to be taken. Previously, the analyser tool worked using infrared absorption, but since 2019 it has worked on the basis of a technique called 'Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy'. Measurements are assured to be reflective of the true composition of the global atmosophere, due to the location of the observatory and the rigour with which measurements are calibrated and independently verified.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temperature** estimates going back over 820,000 years based on the EPICA Dome C Ice Core Deuterium Data. EPICA stands for European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica. It estimates past temperature using deuterium as a proxy. Deuterium is a heavy form of hydrogen (containing one neutron in addition to the one proton found in \"light\" hydrogen). There tends to be less deuterium in ice cores associated with cooler periods than in warmer periods. The reason for this is that during warm periods, more of the lighter form of hydrogen is evaporated away from the surface of the ocean, so that when the moist air moves northwards to the poles, it contains a higher ratio of heavy hydrogen than it contains during cold periods; precipitation then contains more of this heavy hydrogen and this ultimately shows up in the ice cores. I will refer to this dataset as the \"Jouzel\" dataset for convenience (Jean Jouzel is a leading glaciologist and climatologist who is one of the creators of the dataset). I will use this dataset to calculate the Anarctic temperature anomaly for the period from 820,000 years ago to 1850 AD.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Global **temperature anomaly** data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Measurements for the anomaly are taken from 1850 to 2022 and are calculated against the average temperature for the period 1901 to 2000 and are measured in °C Celsius.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Atmospheric **methane** concentrations estimated from ice core data from Antarctica EPICA Dome C and Law Dome. This covers the period from 797446 years ago to the year 1980. The record until around 1004 AD relates entirely to Dome C; the record between around 1004 AD and 1824 AD relates to a combination of Dome C and Law Dome, while the record from 1824 onwards relates almost entirely to Law Dome. I cut the relevant data from a source csv file from the Environmental Protection Agency website and saved it into my working directory; I merged and manipulated the data further using python. Figures for methane are measured in parts per billion by volume.\n",

Carbon dioxide levels also didn't increase hugely over this time period relative to the increases which came after that point (levels increased from around 286 ppm to 313 ppm between 1850 and 1950 according to the IPCC data: an increase of around 9.4% over a century)\n",

One interesting point I notice is that the temperature anomaly reached levels of over 0.5°C above baseline during four years from 1988 to 2007, but only surpassed 0.4°C above baseline twice since 2007; an interesting potential investigation might be to compare levels of CFCs released into the atmosphere versus the temperature anomaly, as the use of CFCs began to be banned from the late 1980s onwards when it was recognised that they played a huge role destroying the ozone layer and in causing global warming. \n",

    "- We can see that methane levels in the atmosphere are estimated to have been very steady at just under 700 parts per billion by volume in the atmosphere over the period 1000 AD to 1750 AD. After this time, methane levels began to increase, with the rate of increase accelerating over time. Levels are now over 1900 ppbv, meaning there is now 2.5 times more methane in the atmosphere than there was in the mid 1700s. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The temperature anomaly data can clearly be seperated into two sections; the first section corresponds to the sparser data which used the average temperature for 1000 AD to 1845 AD as a baseline. The second section plots the more granular annual temperature anomaly data which uses the period 1910 to 2000 as a baseline. As the period from roughly the 1500s to the early 1800s had lower temperatures than the rest of the millenium (the 'Little Ice Age'), it follows that the the average temperature over the period 1000 AD to 1845 AD was lower than the average temperature for the past century. As a result, temperature anomaly data for the first half of the millenium is more likely to be above 0.5°C than the temperature anomaly data for the last century, since it is being measured against a lower base figure."

    "I will now investigate the relationship between global increases in temperature and more local climate conditions. In December 2023, a paper on this topic written by a group of Irish climate scientists appeared in the journal 'Weather and Climate Extremes'; the title of the paper is \"The emergence of a climate change signal in long-term Irish meteorological observation\". The authors used composite data for temperature and rainfall for the island of Ireland to compare seasonal and annual means and extremes for this data, plus pre-defined climate indices based on the data, against the corresponding data for the base period 1961 to 1990 (which they call Standard Climate Normal, or SCN) on the island of Ireland. They used 14 temperature indices and 5 rainfall indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine how different modern climate conditions are to the conditions during this base period, they used a \"signal to noise ratio\"(\"SNR\"), where seperates changes in climate data which are due to a long-term trend versus normal variation in weather which could be expected independent of the presence of any long-term trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "They calculated how unusual conditions would be compared to today, with an SNR < 1 meaning 'normal or familiar', SNR > 1 and < 2 meaning 'unusual', SNR > 2 and < 3 meaning 'unfamiliar' and SNR > 3 meaning 'unknown'. \n",
    "\n",
    "For my analysis, I am going to take a more straightforward approach. I have obtained reliable monthly data going back to 1950 for one of Met Eireann's primary weather observing stations, Mullingar in Co. Westmeath, and climate average data for the period 1961 to 1990 for this same weather station. The period 1961 to 1990 is commonly used as a \"Standard Normal Reference\" period in weather analysis to assess long-term climate change, including by Met Éireann.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mullingar is a town in midlands of Ireland. The climate there might be considered to represent the midlands as opposed to the coastal regions, but this weather station is as good as most to give a picture of a the typical weather at a weather station in Ireland which isn't very close to the coast.\n",

I also know from earlier work in this project that the global temperature anomaly didn't ramp up until around the 1950s - 1960s, so I feel the trade off for not including pre-1940 Irish weather data (which can be difficult to find and can be unreliable) is worth it for the sake of simplifying the task of seeking the presence of climate change signals in the Irish climate. For the same reason, I have chosen one weather station rather than multiple; I am hoping that by calculating the anomaly against the average of a 30 year reference period, and plotting 73 data points which themselves represent annual averages, some of the background variability in the actual weather data over the 73-year period can be smoothed out and the presence or not of a trend linked to wider climate change could be discerned.\n",

Under the least damaging/ most optimistic scenario (called SSP1-1.9 in the document), temperatures are still expected to lie between 1 and 1.9 °C higher on average between 2081 - 2100 than they were betwen 1850 and 1900. For this illustrative scenario to come to pass, the world would need to reach a net-zero situation with regard to CO2 emissions by the 2050s and sustain it indefinitely. The least optimistic scenario sees humanity putting out a net 130 gigatons per year of CO2 by the end of the century (compared with the net figure of 37.55 gigatons produced in 2023) and temperatures in the period 2081 to 2100 being between 3.3 and 5.7 °C hotter than the period 1850 to 1900:"

    "The scenario I predicted for the year 2100 (using linear regression) produced an estimate of 2 °C for that year; such a scenario seems to lie within the second most optimistic scenario of the five scenarios for future temperature, as outlined in the 'Summary for Policymakers' document. This scenario sees a range for average global temperature for the period 2081 to 2100 of 1.3 to 2.4 °C higher than the base period 1850 to 1900. To secure such a scenario, net-zero CO2 emissions would need to be achieved globally by the 2070s, and concentrations of methane, nitrous oxide and sulphur dioxide will need to be reduced enormously too."

In particular, the second half of the year seems to have had particularly extreme temperature, with the article describing an \"almost unbroken streak of daily records in the second half of 2023\", and more than 200 days saw the daily record be broken.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The global temperature was 1.48 °C higher on average than the long-term average before humans started burning lots of fossil fuels. \n",
    "\n",
    "The article describes how, in addition to anthropogenic global warming, the high temperature was due to the El Niño effect; this occurs when the winds which normally blow warm water from east to west start blowing in the other direction, sending warm water eastwards instead. The El Niño effect causes average temperature worldwide to increase. This article (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-64192508 explaining the El Niño effect also outlines how 2020, 2021 and 2022 where La Niña years instead, where warm waters move westwards rather than eastwards, which leads to opposite effects to El Niño events. El Niño and La Niña episodes typically occur every two to seven years, and usually last nine to 12 months, with La Niña episodes being less common than El Niño. I didn't realise when I investigated the temperatures earlier that 2020 to 2022 was impacted by the La Niña effect, but it agrees with my findings of lower temperatures in 2021 and 2022 than in 2019, 2020 and 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the high temperatures of 2023 were linked to the El Niño phenomenon, it remains to be seen whether the higher figures for the global temperature anomaly for 2023 relative to earlier years will persist on into 2024 and whether the warming will accelerate. El Niño is expected to last until at least April 2024."

    "### Summary ###\n",

    "That concludes my investigation into climate data from the Paleolithic to the present day. I found this a challenging project but an engaging one, and I was fortunate to have a pre-existing interest in the subject matter of the project before I began. I had some familiarity with the science but I have learned a lot more over the course of the project and have enjoyed doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all the datasets I used, I tried to cleanse the data as best I could to give myself the best chance of being able to discern the relationships existing behind the data. Crucially, I standardised the measurement of time in each dataset by including a column called 'Years' which represented time in terms of \"years ago\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project, I examined datasets for the history of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, methane concentrations and Anatarctic temperature anomalies, and the relationships existing between each of these. I examined from timescales from 820,000 years ago until the present day. \n",
    "\n",
    "I carried out correlation analyses between recent data for CO2, CH4 and the global temperature anomaly and lead-lag analyses between CO2 and the temperature anomaly, and CO2 and CH4. For CO2 and the temperature anomaly, my correlations implied a slightly stronger correlation between future CO2 and present temperature, which is difficult to interpret. More intuitively, for CO2 and CH4, I found that there is a slight leading relationship between CO2 and CH4, where past CO2 is slightly more strongly associated with present CH4 levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then analysed the relationships between temperature and rainfall anomalies for Mullingar weather station (in Ireland), and the Mullingar temperature anomaly against the Global temperature anomaly. I chose to analyse a single weather station rather than a composite Irish dataset, as the data was easy to find, accurate and complete going back to 1950, and I was satisfied with only testing that far back into the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I fused together all of the datasets I had worked on until that point into CSV and json files (each called 'composite climate data') and exported them to my subfolder in this directory called 'climate data'; these datasets could prove useful in future to any person looking to carry out similar analyses on climate data and who wants to have multiple datasets in the one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then made predictions for the Global temperature anomaly for the next few decades using a simple linear regression model based on the data from the NOAA for that anomaly from 1950 to 2022. I compared this with the published temperature prediction models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Chang; I found that the results of my linear regression model are compare to the more optimistic outcomes envisaged by the IPCC, suggesting that a linear model may not be capture the shocking extent to which the climate is warming up. Indeed, when I investigated for an acceleration in the rate of warming over 2023, I found some evidence in support of that possibilty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data leaves us in no doubt as to the shocking impact which human activities have so far had on the climate; what is more shocking, however, is the thought of how bad things are going to be in the coming decades even in a best case scenario. Like most people, I hope that this worst effects can be mitigated over time but even achieving some degree of mitigation will require huge permanent changes and sacrifice by all, and, as we saw during the pandemic, people find it hard to accept reduced living standards and freedom once they have become accustomed to it, even when they are told that their forgoing it is for the public good. There is also the issue of some countries not taking the issue as seriously as others, or simply not being able to afford to look at the issue in the same way as Westerners can; in much poorer countries, the focus is on immediate survival and getting through the day, and if that requires burning whatever fuel they can or eating whatever foods they feel they need to nourish themselves and their families, they will not be subordinating their short-term needs for the long-term sake of the climate. On the other hand, efforts to tackle the problem need to be successful, because the effects of climate change will be disasterous on a global scale if we don't."
