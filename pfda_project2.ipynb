    "- Atmospheric **carbon dioxide** concentratons from a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); most recent year in dataset is 2001.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Atmospheric **carbon dioxide** concentrations from a 2008 paper in Nature by Luthi et al; most recent year in dataset is 1870 (137 years prior to 2007).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Atmospheric **carbon dioxide** data from the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, providing annual data from 1959 to 2022, when precise measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide first began to be taken. Previously, the analyser tool worked using infrared absorption, but since 2019 it has worked on the basis of a technique called 'Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy'. Measurements are assured to be reflective of the true composition of the global atmosophere, due to the location of the observatory and the rigour with which measurements are calibrated and independently verified.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temperature** estimates going back over 820,000 years based on the EPICA Dome C Ice Core Deuterium Data. EPICA stands for European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica. It estimates past temperature using deuterium as a proxy. Deuterium is a heavy form of hydrogen (containing a neutron in addition to the one proton found in \"light\" hydrogen). In colder periods, there tends to be less deuterium in ice cores than in warmer periods. The reason for this is that during warm periods, more of the lighter form of hydrogen is evaporated away from the surface of the ocean, so that when the moist air moves northwards to the poles, it contains a higher ratio of heavy hydrogen than it contains during cold periods; precipitation then contains more of this heavy hydrogen and this ultimately shows up in the ice cores. I will refer to this dataset as the \"Jouzel\" dataset for convenience (Jean Jouzel is a leading glaciologist and climatologist who is one of the creators of the dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Global **temperature anomoly** data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Measurements for the anomoly are taken from 1850 to 2022 and are calculated against the average temperature for the period 1901 to 2000 and are measured in degrees celsius.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Atmospheric **methane** concentrations estimated from ice core data from Antarctica EPICA Dome C and Law Dome. This covers the period from 797446 years ago to the year 1980. The record until around 1004 AD relates entirely to Dome C; the record between around 1004 AD and 1824 AD relates to a combination of Dome C and Law Dome, while the record from 1824 onwards relates almost entirely to Law Dome. I cut the relevant data from a source csv file from the Environmental Protection Agency website and saved it into my working directory; I will merge and manipulate the data further using python. Figures for methane are measured in parts per billion by volume.\n",

    "- The data from 1850 to 1950 shows that temperature didn't fluctuate greatly and was typically lower than the average for 1910 to 2000 as a whole. Carbon dioxide levels also didn't increase hugely over this time period relative to the increases which come after that point (levels increased from around 286 ppm to 313 ppm between 1850 and 1950 according to the IPCC data: an increase of around 9.4% over a century)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data from 1950 to 2022 shows that temperatures fluctuated a lot more compared to the average for 1910 to 2000 and that for most of the period since around 1965, average temperature at the Antarctic has been higher than this base figure. One interesting point I notice is that the temperature anomaly reached levels of over 0.5 degrees above baseline during four years from 1988 to 2007, but only surpassed 0.4 degrees above baseline twice since 2007; an interesting investigation might be to compare levels of CFCs released into the atmosphere versus the temperature anomaly, as the use of CFCs began to be banned from the late 1980s onwards when it was recognised that they played a huge role destroying the ozone layer and in causing global warming.\n",

    "A manual investigation of the IPCC dataset shows that it took around **53 years** (from 1912 to 1965) for CO2 levels to go from 300 to 320 ppm. According to the Mauna Loa dataset, it then took only **16 years** to increase to 340 ppm (in 1981), **14 years** to reach 360 ppm (in 1995), **10 years** to reach 380 ppm (in 2005) and **10 years** to reach 400 ppm in 2015. The most recent figures for the year 2022 are 418 ppm."

    "Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and the addition of methane into the atmosphere from human economic activity is known to be contributing to atmospheric warming and climate change. It has a 'Global Warming Potential' (GWP) 84 times greater than CO2 (the reference gas used for calculating GWP) over a 20-year period, meaning a tonne of methane would absorb as much infrared thermal radiation as 84 tonnes of CO2; therefore, it's release into the atmosphere is 84 times more potent than an equivilant quantity released of CO2 over that timespan. However, methane has a shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than CO2, so its GWP over much longer timespans (eg. centuries) is lower than its GWP over decades. \n",

    "By way of comparison with the 20-year GWP value of 84 for methane, the 20-year GWP figures for Dichlorodifluoromethane (a CFC responsible for depletion of the ozone layer) is 10800, which highlights how it important it was that the manufacture of CFCs such as this was banned globally in 2010 (although recent studies have found that some CFCs are still being produced illegally in China).\n",
