Project 2 for Programming for Data Analysis module of HDip in Data Analytics from ATU



Note: If amending code, be mindful that changes made to code further down the page may impact on the earlier code; for example, if all of the code is ran, and then an attempt is made to amend superficial details of a plot of one of the upload datasets, an error may occur as the contents of the dataframe which is being plotted may have been amended further down the page. In such a case, a solution is to **clear all outputs and run the code in it's entirity**.
